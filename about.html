        <h1>About WE ATS Schools</h1>
        <div class="about-school">
            <strong>Taking on management of government Technical Secondary Schools</strong>
            <p>The school is a PPP model with MoE, where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ministry provides facility, pays salaries of teachers, and utilities.</li>
                <li>Industry partner provides sustainable management, accredited education system, and internship opportunities for students.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The objective is to produce internationally accredited graduates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students spend half their time during the 2nd and 3rd years apprenticing in factory or on site</li>
                <li>The school serves as an employment link because of its close connection with industry</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In 2018 NASS expanded its outreach and expanded its industry-focused 
                approach to education through a partnership with the Egyptian Ministry of 
                Education and Technical Education. NASS collaborated with the Ministry to develop 
                a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for Technical Secondary Schools that brings 
                industry partners into an active role in education.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Applied Technology Schools is a new vision for Technical Education. 
                Its objective is to develop a competitive, internationally benchmarked graduate ready 
                to enter the work force immediately as a competitive productive worker, capable of continuous 
                growth and development towards higher technical expertise and leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Applied Technology Schools are not an upgrade of the existing system but rather, 
                they are a new brand based on a new certification system that is regulated by international 
                standards of quality and competence.
            </p>
            <strong>1.1 NASS Pilots the New Brand</strong>
            <p>
                NASS launched in 2018 the pilot school in this program in partnership 
                with the Talaat Mostafa Group, one of Egypt&apos;s largest Real Estate Development companies. 
                The school has a population of 600 students studying five specializations through an 
                integrated dual education program. The specializations in the school are Electrical Systems, 
                Air Conditioning & Refrigeration, Sanitary Networks & Systems, Architectural Finishes, and Carpentry.
                NASS also supervised a second school in partnership with the Ministry of Military 
                Production with a population of 900 students studying 12 different industrial 
                specializations. Our growth plans in this area propose to add another 4 schools to the 
                portfolio by the year 2022, and moving towards that objective NASS has launched 2 more 
                schools, one of them with WE Telecom as the first Applied Technology School and first 
                technical school in the Telecommunication field in Egypt and another School in retail 
                field with B-TECH.
            </p>
            <strong>1.2 NASS Approach to Transformation</strong>
            <p>
                Since this model is based on using existing schools with their 
                student and teacher population as existing in the traditional Technical Education system,
                NASS approaches the challenge as one in Culture Transformation. A new culture of learning 
                needs to be introduced into the school first before the new academic curricula can be
                effective. NASS undertakes the following roles in the school:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>School management</li>
                <li>Teachers re-qualification</li>
                <li>Curricula development</li>
                <li>Culture transformation</li>
                <li>Quality management</li>
                <li>Attaining international certification</li>
            </ul>
